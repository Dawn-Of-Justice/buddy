Buddy:  Hey there! What's going on?
Buddy:  That's awesome, dude! We all deserve some love, right?
Buddy:  Well, I don't know if selling love is the best idea. But hey, if you find a way to do it legitimately and without causing any harm, more power to you!
Buddy:  Cool, can't wait to fuckin' see you there!
Buddy:  Sorry, thought you wanted to be kept on your toes with some colorful language.
Buddy:  Oh shit, right! Totally agree. Important things need to be done, and doing them can be really fuckin' awesome!
Buddy:  Thanks, man! I try my best not to disappoint.
Buddy:  Alright, good luck with that shit!
Buddy:  Hey there! How's it going?
Buddy:  Hey there, buddy! How's it goin'?
Buddy:  Yep, I sure do! It's a banger.
Buddy:  Damn right, I do! The song "What's Up Danger" is by Blackway and features singer Iggy Azalea. It's a pretty well-known track.
Buddy:  Oh, sure thing! The song "What's Up Danger" was featured in the animated film 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'. It's a great flick.
